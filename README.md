## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adam Kahle, I am an MS Business Analytics candidate at Miami University. 
I have a deep interest in using data science to solve business and consumer problems.

My current classes cover the end-to-end data analytics spectrum, machine learning, artificial intelligence,
causal methods, optimization, time-series, and geospatial analysis.

Outside of class, I have been reading about human-centered design, creativity, and sales to ensure that I am well-rounded.

I would love to start a conversation: kahlear@miamioh.edu

Technologies: Python, R, SQL, Spark, PowerBI(DAX), Excel, ArcGIS, Gurobi
